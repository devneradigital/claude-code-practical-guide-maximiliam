# Undoing Actions & The Importance of Version Control Systems

Sometimes, you cannot be satisfied with a claude change in your code.

Claude code offers `/rewind` command that will got back the previous code that it's just changed.

However, can be buggy. So, the best alternative is **VERSION CONTROL SYSTEMS** (git commits).

# Commands, Shortcuts and Settings Cheat Sheet

Claude Code has a long list of supported [CLI commands & flags](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/cli-reference), [shortcuts](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/interactive-mode) and [settings](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/settings).

In my experience, the defaults are fine for most cases, except for permissions (e.g., prevent access to `.env` or similar files) or sandboxing - hence my more detailed coverage in the past videos.

But here's a short list of commands and settings you should be aware of. Many of them were or will be covered in the course lectures, too.

## CLI Commands & Flags

For all available commands and flags, see the [official docs](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/cli-reference).

`claude` / `claude "my prompt"` => Start a new Claude Code session, optionally with an initial prompt.

`claude -p "my prompt"` => Query Claude Code with "my prompt" and quit session once it's done (no ongoing session).

`claude -c` => Continue most recent session.

`claude --agent DocsExplorer` => Start a new session with a custom agent (instead of the default one). **Custom agents will be covered later in the course.**

`claude --allowedTools "Read" "Write"` => Skip permission confirmation dialog for specified permissions.

`claude --disallowedTools "Write"` => Disallow certain tools (specified tools are removed from Claude Code's context => it doesn't know about them).

`claude --dangerously-skip-permissions` => Skip ALL permissions confirmation dialogs. **Use with great caution!**

`claude --append-system-prompt "Always check if redundant code can be deleted"` => Append an instruction to the default system prompt. Can be used as session-specific alternative to instructions placed in CLAUDE.MD (**CLAUDE.MD will be covered later**).

`claude --model opus` => Sets the default model for the current session. Can be changed in the session via `/model`, or generally via settings (see below). For valid options, see the [official list](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/model-config#model-aliases).

`claude --permission-mode plan` => Start in plan mode (default is "default" mode where Claude Code asks for permissions). For available options, see the [official list](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/iam#permission-modes). "Plan" mode will be covered later.

`claude --remote "Add dark mode"` => Start a remote (web) session (will be covered later in the course).

`claude --system-prompt "You are a React.js expert"` => Replace the entire default system prompt with a custom one.

## Claude Code Interaction

When inside a Claude Code session, you can use the following shortcuts for additional control. For all available shortcuts and commands, see the [official docs](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/interactive-mode).

`SHIFT + ENTER` / `OPTION + ENTER` / `CTRL + J` => Enter new line. Exact command depends on platform and terminal software used.

`SHIFT + TAB` => Switch through different modes ("default", "write permissions", "plan").

`CTRL + C` => Cancel current input or generation.

`ESC` => Cancel current generation (can be used to inject a new prompt into an ongoing task).

`ESC + ESC` => Restore the code prior to the last action performed by Claude Code.

`OPTION + P` / `ALT + P` => Switch model. Alternative to `/model` which can be useful if you already entered a prompt.

`ARROW` keys (left / right / top / down) => Cycle through options or questions (left / right) or past message (up / down).

`CTRL + O` => Toggle verbose output (more / less details).

`CTRL + B` => Move task to background. Important: Claude Code also automatically moves tasks (e.g., exploration tasks) to the background and it's typically quite smart about that.

`CTRL + V` / `CMD + V` / `ALT + V` => Insert text or image into prompt. The exact shortcut depends on your platform and terminal.

`CTRL + O` => Toggle verbose output (more / less details).

## Crucial Commands

`/help` => List available commands and get usage help.

`/model` => Choose the active model for the current session.

`/clear` => Clear session context window (i.e., start a new session, effectively).

`/compact` => Compact (summarize) current session context history and clear it thereafter.

`/config` => Open interactive settings menu.

`/context` => View statistics about current context window & context usage.

`/usage` => View current usage for your active plan (i.e., how much usage remains until the next reset). For more details about plans and usage, see the official [help pages](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/11145838-using-claude-code-with-your-pro-or-max-plan).

`/init` => Analyze project and create initial `CLAUDE.MD` file **(covered later)**.

`/mcp` => View and manage installed MCP servers.

`/permissions` => View and update / change permissions.

`/rewind` => Rewind (undo) to earlier point in conversation, same as ESC + ESC.

`/statusline` => Configure the Claude Code status line.

`/teleport` => Resume a remote Claude Code session (covered later).

## Settings

You can configure (project-specific) settings also interactively via `/settings`. Or in your global, project-specific or local (non-Git-controlled) `settings.json` files (see past lectures).

For all available settings, see the [official docs](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/settings).

`{ "permissions": {...} }` => Manage permissions for all sessions. See previous lectures and official [permissions settings docs](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/settings#permission-settings).

`{ "model": "opus" }` => Manage default AI model used for new sessions.

`{ "alwaysThinkingEnabled": true }` => Whether to enabled "advanced thinking" mode or not. Is on by default. Turning it off will likely yield worse results.

`{ "hooks": {  } }` => Manage hooks (covered later in the course).

`{ "env": { "IS_DEMO": 1 } }` => Environment variables that will be applied to every session.
